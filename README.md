# cf_ai_nam-app
An assignment to build an AI-powered application on Cloudflare. The AI-powered application should include the following components: <br>

- LLM (recommend using Llama 3.3 on Workers AI), or an external LLM of your choice <br>
- Workflow / coordination (recommend using Workflows, Workers or Durable Objects) <br>
- User input via chat or voice (recommend using Pages or Realtime) <br>
- Memory or state <br>

IMPORTANT NOTE:
To be considered, your repository name must be prefixed with cf_ai_, must include a README.md file with project documentation and clear running instructions to try out components (either locally or via deployed link). AI-assisted coding is encouraged, but you must include AI prompts used in "PROMPTS.md". All work must be original; copying from other submissions is strictly prohibited. <br><br>
